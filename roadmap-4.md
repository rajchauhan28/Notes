### **Phase 1: Core Concepts and Fundamentals**

Start by understanding what cloud computing is and how it differs from traditional computing environments.

#### **Key Concepts**:
- **Cloud Service Models**:
  - **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Compute, storage, networking (e.g., AWS EC2, GCP Compute Engine).
  - **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: Development platforms (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine).
  - **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: End-user applications (e.g., Google Workspace, Dropbox).

  - **Private Cloud**: Cloud infrastructure operated solely for one organization.
  - **Hybrid Cloud**: Combines on-premises infrastructure with cloud services.

- **Cloud Computing Benefits**:
  - Scalability, elasticity, pay-as-you-go pricing, global reach, high availability, fault tolerance.

- **Disaster Recovery**: Implement backup, recovery, and multi-region deployment strategies.

#### **2. Serverless Architecture**:
- **AWS Lambda / Azure Functions / GCP Cloud Functions**:
  - Explore how to build event-driven, serverless applications.
  - Learn to use services like **AWS API Gateway** to trigger Lambda functions.

  **Hands-On**:
  - Build and deploy serverless applications (e.g., image processing, chatbots).
  
#### **3. Containers and Kubernetes**:
- **Docker**: Learn how to containerize applications.
- **Kubernetes**: Understand container orchestration with managed Kubernetes services like **EKS (AWS)**, **GKE (GCP)**, or **AKS (Azure)**.

  **Hands-On**:
  - Create Docker containers and deploy them on Kubernetes.
  - Manage scaling, networking, and rolling updates with Kubernetes.
