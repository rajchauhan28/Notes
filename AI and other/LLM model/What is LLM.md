LLMs or Large language models are foundational machine learning models that use deep learning algorithms and understand natural lanugage. These models are trained on massive amounts of text data to learn patters and entity relationships in the language.

## **What can LLMs do?**
- Text classification
- Text Generation
- Text Summarization
- Conversation AI like Chatbot, Question Answering, etc.
- Speech recognition and speech identification\
- spelling corrector
So on....

The size and complexity of the Neural Network as well as the size of the dataset that is was trained on.
 
### Milestone in large language models

 - **BERT** - Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Tranformers
 - **GPT** - Generative Pre-Trained Tranformer
 - **XLM** - Cross-Lingual Language Model
 - **T5** - Text-to-Text Tranformer
 - **Magatron**
 - **M2M100** - Multilingual encoder-decoder (seq-to-seq) model

Thing to notice is that many models are using Transformers as there base -
