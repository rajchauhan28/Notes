Classification can be used in spam mails, categorical classification, document classification, etc.

### Some of the popular classification algorithms in machine learning are -

1) [[Decision Trees]] (ID3, C4.5, C5.0)
2) [[Naive Bayes]]
3) [[Linear Discriminant Analysis]]
4) [[k-Nearest Neighbor]]
5) [[Logistic Regression]]
6) [[Neural Networks]]
7) [[Support Vector Machines (SVM)]]
