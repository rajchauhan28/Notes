To reinstall essential packages and restore the default GNOME desktop environment on Ubuntu, follow these steps:

### 1. **Update Package Lists**
First, ensure your package lists are up-to-date:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

### 2. **Reinstall Ubuntu GNOME Desktop and Required Packages**
To reinstall the default Ubuntu GNOME desktop environment, along with all the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop
```

This command will reinstall the `ubuntu-desktop` meta-package, which includes GNOME, default apps, and other essential components.

### 3. **Reinstall GDM (GNOME Display Manager)**
If you've removed GDM (the display manager used by GNOME), reinstall it:

```bash
sudo apt install --reinstall gdm3
```

You might be prompted to select the default display manager. Choose `gdm3` during the configuration process.

### 4. **Fix Broken Dependencies**
After reinstalling the desktop environment, it's a good idea to fix any broken dependencies that might have occurred:

```bash
sudo apt --fix-broken install
```

### 5. **Remove KDE Dependencies (if not fully removed)**
If you still have remnants of KDE packages, you can remove them with:

```bash
sudo apt purge kde*
```

This will clean up any KDE-related packages.

### 6. **Reboot**
Once the installations are done, reboot your system:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

This should restore your default GNOME desktop environment on Ubuntu, along with any necessary system packages that might have been removed.
